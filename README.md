# DSA-Capstone-Project---Palmora-CS
## Aim: 

   This is to document my DSA project analysis and insights derived from analysis of the Palmora HR Case Study.

## Sources: 

   Palmora Employee Case Study Spreadsheet in csv format
   
   Palmora Bonus Rules Spreadsheet in xlsx format
   

## Tools used: 

   Power BI and associated embedded Power Query tool

## Methodology: 

Structured data was passed through the Power Query tool in Power BI
   
    a.  Columns were checked to ensure no errors by removing rows with NULL or null values in columns cells of Department and Salary

    b.  Cells having no Gender delimited were renamed to "Undisclosed"

    c.  After cleaning, data was loaded and insights derived by answering the questions in the manual.

## Analysis & Conclusion:

  1. Gender distribution by location and department

### Analyzing Salary Structure (Management Focus):
    Accounting Department: gender pay gap exists in Abuja as the female to male ratio is 1:2. In Lagos, pay is still fair across both genders.
    Engineering: In Kaduna, pay for females are more than males. This is attributive to the fact that the nunmber of females are more than their male counterparts.
    Legal: In Abuja & Kaduna there is quite a large pay disparity between males and females as there are more males than females. More females should be employed to balance out this disparity.
    Marketing: In Kaduna, there's also a large pay gap between males and females in ratio 1:2. While in Abuja and Lagos the reverse is the case, with females earning much more than their male counterparts. The large population of males to females especially in Kaduna plays a role in this disparity.
    Product Management: In Abuja & Kaduna, slight pay disparity exists between females and males, though the gap seems to be shortening, indicative of a lesser number of female employee than male. Females slightly earn more than their counterparts in Lagos.
    Sales: Slight disparity between salary of males and females in Kaduna and Lagos. Females earn more than males in Abuja as they're more than males
    Support: There is quite a large disparity in salary between males and females in Lagos.
    Training: In Abuja, female trainners are much more paid than their male counterparts. In Lagos and Kaduna, the gender pay gap towards females is not so obvious as shown by the total salary for the department and number of females and males in these locations.
